## MACHINE LEARNING

Data Understanding
This stage involves exploring the dataset to gain insights into its structure, content, and potential issues.

Data Preparation
Here, the data is cleaned to remove inconsistencies, encoded to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms, and scaled to ensure features have comparable scales.

Splitting Data
The dataset is divided into three subsets:
* Training set: Used to train the model.
* Validation set: Used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
* Test set: Used to evaluate the final model's performance on unseen data.

Model Development
Two models are developed:
* Model Classification for Financial Status: This model categorizes individuals into different financial status groups.
* Model Prediction for Saving Rate: This model predicts the saving rate of individuals.

Training & Validation
The models are trained on the training set and their performance is evaluated on the validation set to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

Model Evaluation
The final models are evaluated on the test set to assess their overall performance and identify areas for improvement.

Deployment Preparation & Integration
This stage involves preparing the models for deployment, such as packaging them into a deployable format and integrating them into a production environment.
