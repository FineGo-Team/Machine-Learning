## Machine Learning Pipeline

### Data Understanding
* Explore the dataset to gain insights into its structure, content, and potential issues.

### Data Preparation
* Clean the data to remove inconsistencies.
* Encode the data to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms.
* Scale the data to ensure features have comparable scales.

### Data Splitting
* Divide the dataset into three subsets:
  * **Training set:** Used to train the model.
  * **Validation set:** Used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
  * **Test set:** Used to evaluate the final model's performance on unseen data.

### Model Development
* **Model Classification for Financial Status:**
  * Categorize individuals into different financial status groups.
* **Model Prediction for Saving Rate:**
  * Predict the saving rate of individuals.

### Training & Validation
* Train the models on the training set.
* Evaluate the models' performance on the validation set to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

### Model Evaluation
* Evaluate the final models on the test set to assess their overall performance and identify areas for improvement.

### Deployment Preparation & Integration
* Prepare the models for deployment, such as packaging them into a deployable format.
* Integrate the models into a production environment.
